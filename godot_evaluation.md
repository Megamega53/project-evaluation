### Summary
Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?

  - Given our group's availability, it is unlikely that we would be able to contribute to this project during the course of the semester. Since issues are opened and closed within a short span of time and seem to require a lot of personal expertise, it would be hard to center our contributions around them.
